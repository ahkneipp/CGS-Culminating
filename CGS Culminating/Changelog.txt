-Version 1.0 Indev - 1/30/15
Time Worked: 1 hour
    +Created main package
    +Created BlackHoleSimulator class
    +Created util Package
    +Created Vector class and get/set methods
    +Created Velocity class

-Version 1.01 Indev - 2/8/15
Time Worked: 2 hours
    +Created Scalar class in util package
    +Created Mass class in util package
    +added methods in Vector class to accept multiple double arguments instead of a single array argument
    -deprecated Vector.setVectorMatrixNotation method for inflexible mathematics
    ~debugged Velocity class to extend com.canine505.util.Vector instead of java.util.Vector

-Version 1.02 Indev - 2/26/15
Time Worked:  5.5 hours
    +Added BlackHoleComponent class
    +Added constructor for Velocity class
    +Added libs package
    +Added StdLib and UnitLib libraries
    +Added isEqualTo method to StdLib (see JavaDoc for more information)
    +Added boolean flag to print or not print debug messages
    +Added ErrorMessageClass for error and debug reporting
    +Added ability for vectors and scalars to guess their metric unit based on the provided unitMultiplier
    +Added final String variables VERSION and LAST_UPDATED
    +Added Gravitational Constant (G)
    +Added Speed of light (c)
    +Added Black hole size calculation based on Mass
    ~Changed vector and mass classes to divide unitMultiplier out so the numbers are handleable.
    ~Found out big numbers weren't actually handleable under the division system and considered methods to solve the problems
    caused by big numbers
    ~Changed Vector class to PhysicsVector for compatibility with the Java standard libraries
